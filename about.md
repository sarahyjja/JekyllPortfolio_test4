ABOUT ME...
I am a designer with a lot of imagination and big dreams.

WHAT I DO
I love designing beautiful, clean and user-friendly websites and identities. I’m passionate about finding good ideas, organizing them, developing them into a project and bringing them to life.

EDUCATION
I graduated with a Bachelor in Graphic Design at ÉSAD (École Supérieure d’Art et de Design), France in 2009. Then I completed a postgraduate school in Multimedia at INFA (Institut National de Formation et d’Application), France in 2012.

In November 2012, I received government funding to develop my own creative business. I ran a small start-up company named Faire Part de toi specializing in personalized greeting cards.
​
Few  years ago, I changed scenery and moved to London. I'm now an accomplished freelance Designer, an art director and on my way to become a developer.
